# Arduino sketch collection

This is a collection of some personal sketches.

Each directory contains:
- A `.ino` file with the program to load in arduino IDE
- A schematic image. Some will be in a schematic software, some are in pictures (pardon my lazyness, 
I will do my best to document it, but feel free to reach out to me via github for more info)

I have a micropython repo with programs for micropython-compatible microcontrollers at
